# Environmental Monitoring Agent

Description:
The Environmental Monitoring Agent is designed to autonomously monitor and manage environmental conditions in a given area. It uses a network of sensors to collect data on air quality, temperature, humidity, and other environmental factors. The agent analyzes this data to identify trends, detect anomalies, and provide actionable insights for environmental conservation and management.

Functions and Tasks:

	•	Data Collection: Integrates with IoT sensors to collect real-time environmental data.
	•	Anomaly Detection: Uses machine learning algorithms to detect anomalies in environmental data, such as sudden changes in air quality or temperature.
	•	Trend Analysis: Analyzes historical data to identify trends and patterns in environmental conditions.
	•	Alert System: Sends alerts to relevant authorities and stakeholders in case of detected anomalies or potential hazards.
	•	Reporting: Generates detailed reports on environmental conditions and trends for analysis and decision-making.
